Welcome to a forgotten era!"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'Now, you might ask, "What exactly is this \u2018Brain\u2019 virus?" And more importantly, why was it created? Well, Brain was more of an uninvited guest at a digital party, attaching itself to otherwise harmless programs\u2014called "host" programs\u2014that unsuspecting users would execute. But don\'t be fooled\u2014these two brothers, the Alvi brothers, weren\u2019t plotting world destruction. No, their goal was to explore the security of MS-DOS versus its competitor at the time, UNIX Xenix. They were also trying to protect their software from illegal use. But before we get ahead of ourselves, let\u2019s dive into the Alvi brothers\' backstory.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Amjad was obsessed with electronics. He spent endless hours at the library, reading what we imagine was something like \u201cFloppy Disks for Dummies\u201d or \u201cMS-DOS for Absolute Beginners.\u201d At one point, he got his hands on a Sinclair ZX80, a DIY kit with its fair share of issues. This led Amjad and Basit to open their own computer repair shop, Brain Services (yes, you read that right, Brain Services). But things took a turn when they developed a heart-monitoring program... which, surprise surprise, got pirated! And boom, Brain was born. It wasn\u2019t made to wreak havoc; rather, it was an exploration of how MS-DOS worked and a way to protect their software from being stolen."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'So, how did this virus spread? Floppy disks, of course! In fact, this is where the story gets really interesting. When you insert a floppy disk infected with Brain into a machine, the virus activates before the operating system even gets a chance to load. And the real kicker? As soon as the virus is running in the computer\'s memory, it infects any other floppy disk that comes into contact with it. This virus was sneaky\u2014it saved its original boot sector and stored it in a special sector of the disk, marking it as "bad" so no one would see it. Pretty clever, right? It was a game of hide-and-seek with your computer\u2019s boot process.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:'But here\u2019s the best part of the story: the Alvi brothers signed their virus. That\u2019s right\u2014if anyone was going to take credit for this digital milestone, they were making sure it was them. And guess what? People noticed their contact info embedded in the virus, and soon the brothers started receiving calls from frustrated users around the world\u2014Pittsburgh, Delaware, Hong Kong, Australia, and beyond\u2014all asking, "How do we remove this virus?"'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"But while the Alvi brothers didn\u2019t mean any harm, Brain set the stage for a revolution\u2014a revolution in malicious software. As the virus spread, copycats began to emerge, and soon Brain evolved into its malicious variant, Brain.b, which could infect hard drives as well."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Enter John McAfee, rest in peace to the legend himself, who saw an opportunity. He created the first-ever antivirus software to detect and remove Brain. This marked the dawn of the antivirus industry, a major milestone in the battle against malicious software."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And what\u2019s the legacy of Brain? Well, Brain\u2019s boot-sector infection method became the template for many future viruses.
