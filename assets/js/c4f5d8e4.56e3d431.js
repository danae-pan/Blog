There, I focused on telecommunications, networking, and wireless technologies. My first internship involved exploring Linux distros and basic hardware at AuTh IT center. I later worked as an audio engineering before pursuing a second master's in Visual Computing at Denmark's Technical University. As a student, I worked for a 2-year period at the LEGO group where I contributed to backend development and security features. At the same time, I was organising events, creating content and graphic design for marketing purposes. Currently, I am working on my master's thesis on insider threats and deception techniques. Beyond academics, I am an art and sports enthusiastics, I like books, cats and movies and in general, I have it as my hobby to create new hobbies.
